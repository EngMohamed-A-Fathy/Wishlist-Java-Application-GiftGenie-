# Wishlist-Java-Application-GiftGenie-
ITI Java2 project for Wish list application with user-friendly interface! Add products you want to purchase or receive as a gift

**Purpose
An app to share and receive wish lists and gifts.

**The whole main idea was built on top of server-client-sockets.
- Client is connected to server through input and output stream by opening a socket between them
- Server is connected to derby database where he can store and retreive all the data.
- 
**Log in (#Genie-1):

In order to store lists, the app will save user data such as name, email and password. This data will then be stored in a Database . When opening the app, the user will therefore have to log in to their account in order to have access to their wishlists. If the user does not have an account, they will have the option of creating a new account. It is important that the user can see what information is needed to log in to their account.

**Make wish list (#Genie-2):
As a user, I want to keep track of my wishes for respective events, so that I have it ready when people ask for them.
As a user, you are able to add an item, there is add item scene where the user can add any item from it to his wishlist

The user needs to be able to make wish lists. When creating a wish list it is practical to be able to make different wish lists for different events. After creating a wish list, wishes can be added to the list.

**See own wish lists (#Genie-3):

As a user, I want to have a way of seeing all the items I have added to wishlist and checking the remaining and gross price of each item, and when it's ready to be claimed.

**Add friends (#Genie-4)

As a user, I want to have a list of my friends who also uses the app. I want to be able to share my wishlist with my friends, and I want them to be able to share theirs with me.

The user needs to be able to add friends. It should be clear and straight-forward how this is done. The most practical way of adding friends would be to add them by their name and username they have registered with. If they want to unfriend a friend, they should be able to do so. The user should also be able to share their wishlists with the friends of their choice.
The user should be able to view the wishlist of his friend and contribute to it with any amount , as far as he has enough cash. 

**Contribution (#Genie-5)
the user also have a cash scene when he can charge any amount he want with a credit card, and if he doesn't have money he should be able to play a game and gain money depending on his score in the game, where he can use it to contribute to his friend

**Setting (#Genie-6)

the user should be able in the setting tab to change the background of all scenes, or change his phone number , or contact us

**Help(#Genie-7) 

the user should be able to read notes about how everything works in the app inside the help scene

**Notification(#Genie-8) 

in all scenes the user has a notification icon, where he can see the last 7 notification , for example if someone sent friend request, or accepted his friend request, or contributed or a gift is ready to be claimed
